When I went to the zoo I saw a gorilla, the gorilla stared back at me.

The gorilla looked at me with curious eyes, it seemed like the gorilla was pondering "is he a gorilla?".

Or maybe, I was just anthropamorphising the gorilla - without a common language, the mind of the gorilla remains a mystery.
